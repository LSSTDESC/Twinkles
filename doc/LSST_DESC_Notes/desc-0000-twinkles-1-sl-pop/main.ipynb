    "The lens system catalog used by Twinkles is found in the data folder of the repository and is labeled as [twinkles_lenses_v2.fits](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/Twinkles/blob/master/data/twinkles_lenses_v2.fits). We started by selecting the subset of 872 OM10 lenses that made up rung 4 in the [Strong Lens Time Delay Challenge](http://timedelaychallenge.org/index.html) ([Liao et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1254)). This set was chosen since it matches the LSST best (discussed in issue [#117](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/Twinkles/issues/117)).  **Question for PJM: What does matches LSST best mean?** However, the original OM10 catalog is incomplete and lacks sizes for the foreground lens galaxies. In addition, our image simulations require an SED for the lens galaxy of each system. Therefore, we decided to assign stellar masses to our OM10 lens galaxies based upon SL2S data and then use this information to assign an SED and radial size from an appropriate CATSIM galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Matching CATSIM galaxies to lensed systems\n",
    "\n",
    "We performed the matching using code in a jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/Twinkles/blob/master/examples/notebooks/MatchingLensGalaxies.ipynb). The process involved three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use SL2S data to generate a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to estimate stellar mass of lens galaxies based upon redshift and velocity dispersion.\n",
    "    * We use the data from Table 3 of [Sonnenfeld et al. (2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4759).\n",
    "    * Derive the GMM using the [XDGMM](https://github.com/tholoien/XDGMM) and [empriciSN](https://github.com/tholoien/empiriciSN) packages by Tom Holoien.\n",
    "2. Assign a stellar mass to the OM10 systems based upon this GMM and the OM10 redshifts and velocity dispersions.\n",
    "3. Use the updated OM10 catalog with stellar masses, redshifts and ellipticities to match against CATSIM galaxies and use best fit galaxies to add SED and radius information to OM10 catalog.\n",
    "    * Matched OM10 galaxies to CATSIM galaxies with a 20% error limit on the three matching parameters.\n",
    "    * 11 OM10 lens galaxies did not have matches within 20% in all three parameters to a CATSIM galaxy. These were not included in the final catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the matching process we had a final catalog of 861 OM10 systems with additional size and SED information needed to generate images. This final catalog was then used as the input for `The Sprinkler`."

    "## `The Sprinkler` Concept and Code\n",
    "\n",
    "**JBK**: Introduce `The Sprinkler` concept, including input and output, and any principles involved. Note: This is mostly taken straight from previous documentation [here](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/Twinkles/blob/master/doc/SLSimDocumentation/strong_lensing_review.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "`The Sprinkler` is the [code](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/Twinkles/blob/master/python/desc/twinkles/sprinkler.py) that matches OM10 lens systems to AGNs in an instance catalog and replaces the instance catalog AGN with one of our lensed systems in the final PhoSim input catalog. To do this we add a step in the CATSIM `final pass` method when creating instance catalogs for PhoSim input and manipulate the array of catalog results before they are printed to file. The first step is loading the OM10-Twinkles catalog we described in the previous section. We then go through the instance catalog AGNs one at a time and see if they match a lens system from our OM10-Twinkles catalog. The matching is done by taking the redshift and magnitude of the CATSIM AGN and selecting any available lens systems with a source AGN that has a redshift within 0.1 dex and an LSST magnorm value (magnitude in a simulated filter with one bin at 500nm) within .25 mags.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the possible matches to a given instance catalog AGN are found there is a chance that it will be replaced that is set by the density parameter in the sprinkler class. In the current Twinkles run it is set at 1.0 so that 198 lens systems are sprinkled into the Twinkles instance catalogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the AGN is chosen to be sprinkled then we proceed with the sprinkler and if there are multiple matches from the OM10-Twinkles catalog we randomly choose one to use as we proceed. First, we remove any disc and bulge information for that galaxy from the instance catalog leaving only the AGN data and copy this AGN entry creating 2 or 4 entries in the catalog depending upon the number of images the OM10 system we are sprinkling in has in total. Next we use the OM10 data for each image to shift the location of the AGN in each image to the correct location and adjust the magnitude for each entry depending on the OM10 magnification parameter for each AGN image. At this point we also adjust the time delay for each image with OM10 info and give all the images the same source redshift from the OM10 entry. Once the new entries are ready they are appended to the instance catalog with a new instance catalog id tag that gives us the ID of the Bulge galaxy in the instance catalog to which it is associated and the ID number of the OM10-Twinkles catalog system that is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to take the original entry in the instance catalog and add in the information for the foreground lens galaxy. Therefore, in this step the AGN and Disc data for the original galaxy are cleared and the redshift and magnitude for the lens galaxy from the OM10 system is added into the instance catalog. Here we also add in the radius of the lens galaxy and the sed file we want to use (the information added to the original OM10 systems in the process described in the last section). We also add in the OM10 position angles and ellipticities at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have gone through this process for all AGN in the instance catalog then we return to the normal instance catalog processing to write the information out to file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**JBK**: Show Sprinkler operating on OM10 sample made in previous section and producing an example (or the actual!) instance catalog. Note: I am basically going to follow the example [here](../../../examples/notebooks/Sort_Objects_in_ICs.ipynb) to process the instance catalog before the results section. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The matching of lensed systems seemed to take place outside `the sprinkler` - why is this? Do we want to refactor so that `the sprinkler` handles everything? I think this might be helpful...\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will use the sprinkler in the Twinkles code to generate a full instance catalog for the Twinkles field. To set up Twinkles you can follow the instructions [here](../../Setup/Getting_started_on_your_laptop.rst#gravitational-lens-sprinkling-setup). Below we will create an instance catalog using the LSST OpSim database `minion_1016` and for visit `230`."

    "The mismatches in the plots above are most likely due to errors in the sprinkler discovered while writing this note:\n",

    "1. When matching AGN magnitudes the sprinkler should redshift the AGN SED before finding the magnitude scaling to match the OM10 I-band magnitudes. It currently matches the rest frame AGN SED to the observed OM10 I-band magnitudes. \n",
    "2. When calculating the magnitude scaling for the lens galaxy it should use the associated lens galaxy SED in the updated Twinkles-OM10 catalogs instead of the generic LRG SED we included as a placeholder originally. It should also include the redshift when calculating the magnitude scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct method for calculating the expected magnitude (before background effects) in PhoSim is used to make the plots above and shows the results that these errors have on the inputs. For the lens galaxies with smaller redshifts the effects seem to be small and since all the SEDs used in the catalog should be similar to our LRG placeholder it doesn't seem that these effects were significant either. The errors do seem significant in our lensed AGN however. Our PhoSim inputs seem shifted to be brighter than they should be according to OM10."

    "`sprinkler` seems to work well, inserting lensed quasars into PhoSim inputs. Speed of operation? Is this the rate-limiting step? \n",
    "\n",
    ">The `sprinkler` adds ~19% in a test on my laptop to the instance catalog generation with full density in the sprinkling step. Decreasing the density did not actually result in a significant time savings. Perhaps we could do some more caching to decrease this if it's a blocker to more general use, but considering the time we spend on instance catalog generation versus image generation I don't see this as a large problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling up to larger sky areas - any problems foreseen?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Other than the added time for instance catalog generation I don't see any problems in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quasar host galaxies are ignored for now, but could be matched and inserted (Li and Wiesner in prep).\n",
    "\n",
    ">I have tested this during the SLAC Hack Day 2017 and I have a branch with this work that could be used to iterate with PhoSim when Nan and Matt are ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lensed supernovae? OM10 produced a mock SN catalog that could be used.\n",
    "\n",
    ">This is certainly something we could add as a sprinkler add-on."
